    "### Task 1. Finnish vowel harmony ###\n",

    "\n",
    "You need rules that say that the archiphonemes A, O and U are realized as the back vowels a, o and u, respectively, when there is a backvowel (a, o, u) earlier in the word, which is followed by any characters _other than_ the front vowels ä, ö, y or the internal word break character #, which is used inside compound words.\n",

    "You need rules that say that any remaining archiphonems A, O, U are realized as the back vowels ä, ö and y, respectively.\n",

    "### Task 2. Finnish consonant gradation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2 contains both a lexicon and rules. Your task is to add the rules that will produce correct surface forms for all given words in the _nounstems_ sublexicon below. The example words have been taken from page 40 of the slides of the second language technology lecture. More words have been added, but they all follow the same inflection patterns. Familiarize yourself with the consonant gradation patterns, which are shown in the slides. Then start writing your rules. Keep in mind the following:\n",
    "* Your rules should convert the strong grade to weak grade, when a _closed syllable_ follows.\n",
    "* Hence, you need to figure out how you can model a closed syllable in the right-hand side context of your rules.\n",
    "* Your rules should keep the strong grade, when an _open syllable_ follows; however, this already works properly, so you don't need to add any rules for strong grade and open syllables.\n",
    "* The order of the rules is important; usually more specific rules should come before more general rules.\n",
    "* You do not have to model vowel harmony in this task, since all words have back vowels.\n",
    "* You should write _linguistically motivated, general rules_. That is, you should not write limited rules for every stem _or_ suffix separately; you should not write a rule, such as: 'k' is dropped in 'sika' when followed by 'n', 'lla', 'lta', 'lle', etc.\n",
    "* Your rules should drop the end of stem marker ^.\n",
    "* For the weak grade of _ruoka_ you may choose which spelling you prefer.\n",
    "* You don't have to write rules for i/e alternation at the end of the stem. That is why the intermediate forms of \"kurki\" and \"olki\" are already given as \"kurke\" and \"olke\", as in the forms: *kurkena*, *olkea*.\n"
