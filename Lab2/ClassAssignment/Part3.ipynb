    "We continue working on English verbs. Below, the entire program has been entered into one single cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, copy over the rules you added in Part 2, so that your morphological lexicon works as in Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will notice that we have added some new verb stems for you. As it turns out, the rules that you already have are now _insufficent_. Please, add new rules, or modify the existing ones, in order to fix the following issues: \n",
    "* If the verb ends in a vowel followed by -y, then -y does not change to -i- before an ending starting in -e: played, enjoyed.\n",    
    "* If the verb ends in a vowel followed by -y, then an -e- is not added before the ending -s; for instance: plays, enjoys.\n",
    "* If the verb ends in -ie, then -ie changes to -y before the ending -ing; for instance: die -> dying; lie -> lying.\n",
    "* If the the verb ends in double-e: -ee, then no -e is dropped before -ing; for instance: agreeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to modify your existing rules, if you need to. Also pay attention to the correct ordering of your rules. Remember that you can add _apply_ commands to debug your rules."
